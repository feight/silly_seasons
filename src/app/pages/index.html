                    <h1>Synopsis</h1>

                    <p>
                        Silly Seasons is an animated CG comedy featuring the escapades of four girls, Daisy,
                        Summer, Ginger and Snowflake, who all live in the town of Sillyville with a supporting
                        cast of offbeat animals and flowers.  The 26 x 24' series is a lighthearted and
                        irreverent take on relationships and life in general; the show is aimed at 8-12 y.o. girls.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The four girls are the only humans in the series as well as the only kids. All the other
                        characters - anthropomorphic animals and plants - are adults. This forms the foundation for
                        comedy, as the series parodies adult behavior and attitudes towards kids in a fun and humorous way.

                            modified toaster.

                            Gossip is her middle name and nothing stands in the way of Venus and a delicious scoop, not
                            even the facts.

                            does is to foil or expose Cameron. She loves to tease Cameron and seems to warm to anyone but
                            him, however, their relationship endures despite them both.

            <h1>About the Flying Circus</h1>

            The Flying Circus produces CG animated kids-comedy using a state of the art motion capture system.  Our production philosophy utilizes experienced physical theatre performers, and as a result, the process delivers a fresh and spontaneous style of animation with fast and snappy dialogue. 

            Improvisation between the actors and the 'live' nature of the performances gives a unique feel to the animation and allows a large degree of flexibility during production.  

            The advantage of a motion capture-based production process is its ability to quickly turn around multiple episodes once all the 3D assets are developed while still retaining high production values.
